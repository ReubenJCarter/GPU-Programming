each exicution of fragment, processes one fragment shader code module.

fragment -i "gpu-code-file" -o "output image file name" -b "output raw binary file name" -x "128" -y "128" (size of the image)

-i parameter required for exicution!
Note: Some sizes of image do not work. It is best to stay with powers of 2 sizes. It all depends on the 
system you are using as to what image sizes are supported.
