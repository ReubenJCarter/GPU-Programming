each exicution of fragment, processes one fragment shader code module.

fragment 
-i "gpu-code-file" 
-o "output image file name" 
-b "output raw binary file name" (doesnt work yet, may never...)
-x "128" 
-y "128" (size of the image)
-r "input image file name"
-z (specifiy image resize to match power of 2)

-i parameter required for exicution!
Note: Some sizes of image do not work. It is best to stay with powers of 2 sizes. It all depends on the 
system you are using as to what image sizes are supported.
